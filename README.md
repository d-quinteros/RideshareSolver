# Ride Share Program Optimization

Sally Lee, DQ

## Background

Ride-sharing platforms such as Uber have the problem of optimally allocating
rides to achieve maximum profitability under the constraints of significant
operating limits such as distance, trips, and other resource limitations.
Optimization of such a variable is of great significance for maximizing the
overall system performance and customer satisfaction. As there has been a growth
in ride-sharing services, optimizing such problems becomes more complex with
multiple variables and constraints, thus higher-level algorithms need to be
applied for this.

In our project, we used the Interior Point Method (IPM) to optimize the
ride-sharing problem. It is a powerful algorithm for solving large-scale linear
and nonlinear convex optimization problems and therefore most apt for this
purpose. Utilizing IPM, we were able to find the optimum solution for the
assignment of rides and profit maximization in terms of operational constraints
such as total distance and number of trips.

## Walkthrough

### Step 0: Problem Setup
The objective of this problem is to maximize profit from providing transportation services, given constraints on distance and the total number of trips. Three trip types are available: long-distance (50km, $40 profit), medium-distance (30km, $20 profit), and short-distance (10km, $5 profit). The constraints are a maximum total distance of 1000 kilometers and a maximum of 20 total trips. The goal is to determine the optimal number of each trip type to maximize the total profit, subject to these constraints and the non-negativity of the number of trips.

1. **Decision Variables**
	* $x_1$: Number of long-trip passengers
	* $x_2$: Number of medium-trip passengers
	* $x_3$: Number of short-trip passengers
2. **Objective Function**
	* Maximize profit:
	$$
	z = 40x_1+20x_2+5x_3
	$$
3. **Constraints**
	* Distance constraint:
	$$
	50x_1+30x_2+10x_3 \le 1000
	$$
	* Number of trips constraint:
	$$
	x_1+x_2+x_3 \le 20
	$$
	* Non-negativity:
	$$
	x_1, x_2, x_3 \ge 0
	$$

The cost vector `c` represents profit per passenger type, while `A` and `b` define the constraint matrix and bounds. The algorithm initializes `x` (the decision variables) to a small positive value to keep them strictly positive, preventing division by zero later in the process. Slack variables `s` are introduced to maintain feasibility, and the Lagrange multipliers `Î»` (dual variables) track constraint violations.

Slack variables play a crucial role in transforming inequality constraints into equalities, making them easier to work with in a system of equations. So, an inequality constraint such as:
$$
\text{distance constraint}: 50x_1+30x_2+10x_3 \le 1000
$$
would be rewritten using a slack variable `s_1` as:
$$
50x_1+30x_2+10x_3 +s_1 = 1000
$$
This helps to make sure that that the solution remains feasible while allowing us to incorporate constraints directly into our iterative update process.

Lagrange multipliers help to measure how much the objective function would improve if a constraint were slightly relaxed. Conceptually, they represent the "pressure" that a constraint exerts on the solution

### Iterative Optimization Process
At each iteration, the algorithm constructs three key residuals:
1. **Dual Residual (r_d)**: Measures the difference between the gradient of the Lagrangian and the actual cost vector. If this is nonzero, it means the current solution is not optimal.
$$
r_d = A^T \lambda+s-c
$$
2. **Primal Residual (r_p)**: Represents how much the current solution violates the constraints. Ideally, this should be zero when the algorithm converges.
$$
r_p = Ax -b
$$
4. **Complementary Slackness Residual (r_c)**: Ensures that slack variables `s` and decision variables `x` remain balanced. 
$$
r_c = XS - \mu
$$
Here $X$ and $S$ are diagonal matrices with `x` and `s`along the diagonal.

These residuals form a system of equations that is solved at each iteration. The algorithm builds the **KKT matrix**, a block matrix that encodes the relationships between primal variables, dual variables, and slack variables. Solving this system updates all variables, guiding the solution toward optimality.
